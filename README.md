This is my personal website, using the Minimal Theme. Here you can find my curriculum as a programmer, statistician and researcher.

*Minimal is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. You can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](http://pages-themes.github.io/minimal), or even [use it today](#usage).*
