When we first met, I found  
myself blinder than that date  
Fool as I was, I derogated  
When stars started to be laid out.  

Were we just fooling around  
or were we sealing our fate?  
Were we doomed to be soulmates  
Even before love came about?  

When we last met, I only knew  
neither of us have been the same  
since love made his first debut.  

A mere infatuation hence became  
a more resolute, stronger tissue  
bonding two hearts hard to tame!
