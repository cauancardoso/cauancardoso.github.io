[I've created my Interactive Resume (or Curriculum Vitae) using Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/cauan.cardoso#!/vizhome/CV_15638506371700/CV). Here I'll show how you can create one for yourself too.

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) is a very intuitive software that creates amazing dashboards ([and more](https://www.tableau.com/#hero-video)). It's not cheap, but if you're a student like me, I have great news: [Tableau is free for students](https://www.tableau.com/academic).

There is also a free version of Tableau for everyone: [**Tableau Desktop Public Edition**](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download/). All your data visualizations (up to 10 GB) are stored on your public profile on the [Tableau Public Social Network](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).

First things first, I used [Tableau Desktop Public Edition](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) version 2019.2.1 to this project.

### Create an Excel spreadsheet with all your academic, professional and personal information

Tableau can read data from Excel files to create powerful data visualizations. The first step to create you interactive resume is to put all information you want in it into Excel worksheets.

Have in mind that each worksheet you create will turn into a table or graphic in your resume. So, if you want loads of tables and graphics, you'll have to create a proportional amount of worksheets.

[My resume](https://cauancardoso.github.io/cv/) has eight parts: introduction, work experience, academic history, training, awards, publications, participation in events and languages; and my spreadsheet also has eight worksheets.

[Watch this wonderful tutorial by Lani Beadle](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/blog/2016/09/how-create-interactive-resume-tableau) to learn how I've created every single part of my curriculum.

### Custom layouts to your interative resume

Tableau allows you to create and edit custom layouts to your dashboards, optimizing the visualization on mobile devices and desktops. Use this in your favor: create custom layouts to your resume and impress everyone with your amazing skills! Afterall, you can never tell from where that opportunit you were waiting for will come.
